Very handy, thanks! You can also get it with wget:
wget --no-check-certificate http://gist.githubusercontent.com/kmorcinek/2710267/raw/.gitignore

Doesn't ignore bin and obj folders:
I am on VS 2015 Update 3.

I know this is late. but might help someone
@tejpratapsingh
If you have already added the bin and obj folders in git. you will have to remove them since git ignore does not work on files already in git
use command
git rm -r --cached <path to bin, obj folders>
git commit -m "untracking bin and obj"
now the gitignore works on bin and obj
